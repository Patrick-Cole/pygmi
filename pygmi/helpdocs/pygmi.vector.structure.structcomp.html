		<h1>Structure Complexity</h1>
		<p>Structure complexity takes as input lines, from a shapefile or similar. It then produces different measures of structure complexity, in gridded form. The vector data is rasterized, and a window is passed over the rasterized version of the lines to calculate measures.</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Method - This can be 'Feature Intersection Density', 'Feature Orientation Diversity', 'Circular Variance and Dispersion' or 'Feature Fractal Dimension'.</li>
			<li>Cell size - This represents the size of a square raster grid cell, in the units of the grid (normally meters).</li>
			<li>Intersection Density Standard Deviation - the variance of a gaussian centered on each intersection. It represents the area of influence each intersection has. It is in the units of the grid (normally meters).</li>
			<li>Intersection Density Line Extension - Distance to extend features which are almost touching, so that an intersection between features is obtained.</li>
			<li>Window Size - Size of windows to calculate measure.</li>
		</ul>
