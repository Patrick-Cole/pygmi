		<h1>Raster Data Display</h1>
		<p>This allows for the display of data in a variety of ways common to most image processing packages. The resultant dataset can then be exported as a geotiff for vector interpretation in a GIS package. Each display type is discussed below.</p>
		<h2>Display Type</h2>
		<p> This gives options for different types of maps. They are as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>Single Colour Map - displays a single band of data by mapping its values to a colour map or colour table.</li>
			<li>Contour - This has the same options as the single colour map, but displays the data using contours instead.</li>
			<li>RGB Ternary - displays three bands, one red, one green and one blue. Because of this, no colour map can be chosen, and now three bands must be chosen.</li>
			<li>CMYK Ternary - displays three bands, one cyan, one magenta and one yellow. As before, no colour map can be chosen, and now three bands must be chosen.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Data Bands</h2>
		<p>The bands to  be displayed are chosen here.</p>
		<h2>Histogram Stretch</h2>
		<p>The choice of how to map the data is chosen here. The options are:
		<ul>
			<li>Linear with Percent Clip - compacts a % of the outliers of the data, as chosen by the user.</li>
			<li>Histogram Equalisation - gives all colors the same amount of data samples, so that maximum change is seen in the map)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The user must press to apply button once the setting is changed.</p>

		<h2>Colour Bar</h2>
		<p>Here you can choose the colour bar to map the colours with.</p>

		<h2>Sunshade</h2>
		<p>This option applies a sunshade algorithm to the data, with the colour overlay being chosen in the Display Type step. Options are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sun Angle - This is chosen by clicking on a small circular map. A blue dot denotes the sun's azimuth and elevation.</li>
			<li>Sunshade Detail - controls how much sunshade detail is present. Decrease this to increase the detail.</li>
			<li>Light Reflectance - controls the light reflectance of the surface. </li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Save Geotiff</h2>
		<p>Use this to save your final maps as a Geotiff. This will also save two colour bars (one vertical and one horizontal) or a ternary colour bar. The size of the colour bar relates to how big you wish it to be on the paper map.</p>
