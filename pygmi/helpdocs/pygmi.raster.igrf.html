		<h1>Calculate IGRF Corrected Data</h1>
		<p>This calculates IGRF corrected version of the magnetic data. It requires, as input, a magnetic dataset for an area as well as a digital elevation model. Since the IGRF correction relates to latitude and longitude, the projection of the input dataset is required.</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<h3>Input Projection</h3>
		<p>The choice of projection is obtained through drop boxes.</p>
		<h3>IGRF Options</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Sensor Clearance above ground - This is the height, in meters, of the sensor measuring the magentic field, above the ground.</li>
			<li>Date - This is the survey date. The IGRF field changes depending on when the magnetic data was collected, so the survey date must be taken into account.</li>
			<li>Digital Elevation Model - raster grid of the terrain in height above sea level.</li>
			<li>Magnetic Data - raster grid of the magnetic data to be corrected.</li>
		</ul>
