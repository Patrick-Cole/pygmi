		<h1>Tilt Angle Calculation</h1>
		<p>This calculates the tilt angle of the data. It allows for smoothing as well. It outputs the Standard tilt angle, Hyperbolic tilt angle, 2nd order tilt angle, Tilt Based Directional Derivative and the Total Derivative</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Smoothing Matrix - an odd matrix used to smooth the data</li>
			<li>Azimuth - This is the direction of the tilt angle, in degrees from east. It is used in the tilt based directional derivative.</li>
		</ul>
