		<h1>Data Display</h1>
		<p>The data display tab is used to view the data you are modelling, as well as the results of your calculations. It can also be used to show you the location of the profile you are currently modelling.</p>
		<p>The slider below the image allows for the fading of one dataset into another. This is useful, for example, when comparing calculated gravity data to the measured gravity data.</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Profile - allows for the display and/or selection of the profile being modelled. The Northing associated with the profile is also displayed.</li>
			<li>Profile Orientation - The profiles can be modelled either west-east or south-north. This allows for selection the modelling direction. <b>It is the only place to do so.</b></li>
			<li>Drop Boxes - These two drop boxes select which datasets to display. By default this is set to calculated data. The data is blue if nothing is calculated yet.</li>
			<li>Slider - This allows for the fading of the one image into another. This is useful when comparing your calculated field versus your actual field.</li>
		</ul>
