		<h1>Data Merge and Resampling</h1>
		<p>This will allow datasets to be merged and resampled to a common cell size. It can also be used for a single dataset to be resampled. The resulting rows and columns of the new grid are displayed.</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Cell size - This represents the size of a square raster grid cell, in the units of the grid (normally meters).</li>
			<li>Common mask for all bands - This option forces the nodata areas to be the same on all bands.</li>
		</ul>
