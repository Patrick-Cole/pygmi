		<h1>Dataset Mosaic</h1>
		<p>This will allow datasets to be mosaiced. The input is a directory which contains ONLY data to be mosaiced.</p> 
		<p>If all files to be mosaiced have the same number of bands, in the same order (band name is not checked) then a fast mosaic will result. This is the default. Alternatively, the user can merge files with different numbers of bands, and only bands with common names will be merged. This option is slower. If files being mosaiced have z values which are offset, the user can select to shift the bands to their respective median value prior to merge to minimise this. In this case a slower mosaic will result.</p>
		<h2>General Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Batch directory - location of files to be mosaiced.</li>
			<li>Shapefile for boundary - This is an optional location for a shapefile to be used to cut the mosaic to a specific boundary.</li>
      <li>Nodata Value - Optional definition for the nodata/null value.</li>
			<li>Mosaic by band labels, since band order may differ, or input files have different numbers of bands. - checked by default.</li>
			<li>Shift bands to median value before mosaic. May allow for cleaner mosaic if datasets are offset - unchecked by default.</li>
			<li>Save each band separately in a mosaic directory - this is useful when the resultant mosaic is too large.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Mosaic Method</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Median - shift last file to median overlap value and copy over first file at overlap.</li>
			<li>First - copy first file over last file at overlap.</li>
			<li>Last - copy last file over first file at overlap.</li>
			<li>Min - copy pixel wise minimum at overlap.</li>
			<li>Max - copy pixel wise maximum at overlap.</li>
		</ul>
