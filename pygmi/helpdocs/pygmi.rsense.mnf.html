		<h1>Minimum Noise Fraction</h1>
		<p>This module performs Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) on data, with the aim of performing noise filtering. Upon completion of the calculation, a graph of explained variance is displayed, which can be used to assist in defining the optimal number of components for filtering.</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Forward Transform Only - This outputs the forward transformed data with teh full number of components.</li>
			<li>Number of components - Number fo components used in the inverse transform (if calculated).</li>
			<li>Noise estimated by average horizontal and vertical shift - This is the noise estimation as performed in ENVI.</li>
			<li>Noise estimated by diagonal shift.</li>
			<li>Noise estimated by local quadratic surface - Option recommended by Berman et al (2012), but slower.</li>
		</ul>
