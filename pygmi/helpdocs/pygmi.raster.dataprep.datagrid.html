		<h1>Dataset Gridding</h1>
		<p>This is a simple, fast, gridding routine for an x,y,z dataset. The routine itself finds the average of the neighbouring area and assigns that to the grid cell. It is perfect for quickly looking at your data, bearing in mind that it is probably not the perfect routine for representing all data.</p>
		<p>The input is a point or line dataset, imported from the vector menu. Note that the x and y columns must be the first two columns in your dataset.</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Cell size - This represents the size of a square raster grid cell, in the units of the grid (normally meters).</li>
			<li>Column to grid - This allows you to select the z column to grid.</li>
			<li>Null value.</li>
		</ul>
