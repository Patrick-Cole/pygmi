		<h1>Export to Google Earth kmz</h1>
		<p>Models can be exported to Google Earth kmz format in either smooth or original (blocky) format. Although the models themselves are in meters, it is important to know that the location of such models are in latitude and longitude. For this reason, you need to confirm the projection of the model.</p>
		<p>Please note that the model heights will be adjusted to follow a curved earth, since Google Earth is a sphere.</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Model Projection - The projection of the model, and grids associated with the model.</li>
			<li>Smooth Model - Used to indicate whether the model output should be smoothed for aesthetic purposes.</li>
		</ul>
