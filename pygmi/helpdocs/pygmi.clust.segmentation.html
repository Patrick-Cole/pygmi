		<h1>Image Segmentation</h1>
		<p>This tool performs image segmentation, following the technique by Baatz and Schäpe (2000).</p>
		<p>It has the following parameters:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Compactness weight.</li>
			<li>Color weight.</li>
			<li>Maximum allowable cost function.</li>
			<li>Use DBSCAN to group segments.</li>
			<li>DBSCAN eps - The maximum distance between the mean signature between two segments, for one to be considered as in the neighborhood of the other. The input data is scaled using a standard scaler function (removing the mean and scaling to unit variance).</li>
		</ul>
