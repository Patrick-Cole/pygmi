		<h1>Band Ratio Calculations</h1>
		<p>This module allows the user to calculate ratios from a list of standard ratios found in the literature. It takes as input either a standard import of remote sensing data, or input from a batch list. The user must select the relevant satellite and confirm which ratios are needed. Ratios are automatically exported to GeoTIFF format with the suffix _ratio.tif</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Sensor - satellite sensor to base ratios on.</li>
			<li>Ratios - selection for ratios available for the chosen sensor.</li>
			<li>Invert selection - convenience button to invert the condition indices selection.</li>
		</ul>
