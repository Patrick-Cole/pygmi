		<h1>Calculate Change Indices</h1>
		<p>Change Detection Indices give a measure of change in an area. The input to this module is a list of datasets loaded using the batch importer. Each dataset must also have an associated date. The import tool for satellite scenes should assign a date automatically, but should a manual date need to be assigned, this can be done within the metadata context menu. A variety of change indices can be calculated:</p>
		<h2>Indices</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Difference - calculates the difference between two dates.</li>
			<li>Mean - average pixel value image over all dates.</li>
			<li>Standard Deviation - shows pixel variation though standard deviation.</li>
			<li>Coefficient of Variation - measure of variation, taking mean into account.</li>
			<li>Spectral Angle Mapper - find spectral angle between two scenes.</li>
		</ul>
