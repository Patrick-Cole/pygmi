		<h1>Hyperspectral Feature Processing</h1>
		<p>This module takes as input hyperspectral data with wavelengths, and allows for a standard set of feature definitions to be calculated. Currently this includes mica, smectite, kaolin, chlorine, epidote and ferrous iron. Once a product is selected, the details of the various datasets which make up the calculation are shown on a table, including feature name, filter, threshold and description. The user is able to alter the respective dataset threshold. </p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Product - includes mica, spectate, kaolin, chlorine, epidote and ferrous iron.</li>
			<li>Details - including feature name, filter, threshold and description. The user is able to alter the respective dataset threshold. .</li>
		</ul>
