		<h1>Dataset Reprojection</h1>
		<p>This is a versatile routine allowing for the reprojecting of a dataset between two projections. All projections are obtained from EPSG codes. </p>

		<h2>Options</h2>
		<p>The options are the same for both input and output projections. The choice of projection is obtained through a drop box. The first part of the entry on the drop box shows the datum, and the last part shows the projection.</p>
		<p>Should you wish to project to or from degrees, the entry will be Datum / Geodetic Geographic, where Datum is your local datum of choice.</p>
