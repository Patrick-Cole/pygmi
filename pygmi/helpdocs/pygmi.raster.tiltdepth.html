		<h1>Tilt Depth Interpretation</h1>
		<p>The tilt depth interpretation is a techniques for calculating depths to vertical sided bodies from the magnetic tilt angle. As such it required magnetic data as input.</p>
		<p>This works on the principle that the distance between the -45 degree and 45 degree tilt angle is twice the distance to the body. This zone of interest is highlighted on the map.</p>
		<p>What is important to note is that this technique works best with data which has been reduced to the pole. For this reason, RTP has been built into the module.</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Band to perform tilt depth - this should be magnetic data</li>
			<li>Color Bar - colors used to display the tilt angle data.</li>
			<li>Inclination of Magnetic Field - inclination of the field at the location and date of survey.</li>
			<li>Declination of Magnetic Field - declination of the field at the location and date of survey.</li>
			<li>Recalculate Tilt Depth - used to recalculate after changing inclination or declination.</li>
		</ul>
