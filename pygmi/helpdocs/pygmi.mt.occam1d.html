		<h1>Occam 1D Inversion</h1>
		<p>MT processing makes use of the MTpy library and Occam 1D inversion code. This module applies Occcam 1D inversion to EDI data. Multiple solutions are generated, and a slider is used to view each solution in order to select the appropriate solution. Apparent resistivity and phase versus period are both displayed as graphs. A third graph showing depth versus layer resistivity is also shown.</p>
		<p>OCCAM1DCSEM requires three input files: IterationFile, ModelFile, and DataFile (all of which are generated by MTpy automatically). A directory labelled by the mode (see options below) is created as a subdirectory to the input EDI file directory and contains these files. This new directory contains the Occam 1D iteration (.iter) and output response (.resp) files. Full descriptions can be found in <a href="https://marineemlab.ucsd.edu/Projects/Occam/1DCSEM/">here</a>.
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Station Name - Used to select a station, which is then displayed in the graph. </li>
			<li>Mode - can be TE, TM or DET</li>
			<li>Resistivity Errorbar - either specified as 'data' or in units of %</li>
			<li>Phase Errorbar - either specified as 'data' or in units of %</li>
			<li>Resistivity Error Floor - in units of %</li>
			<li>Phase Error Floor - in degrees</li>
			<li>Height of air layer - in units of metres</li>
			<li>Bottom of model - in units of metres</li>
			<li>Depth of target to investigate - in units of metres</li>
			<li>Depth of first layer - in units of metres</li>
			<li>Number of layers - refers to model layers</li>
			<li>Maximum iterations - maximum number of iterations Occam uses to compute</li>
			<li>Target RMS - target RMS misfit.</li>
			<li>Invert Station - used to get Occam 1D to invert the current station</li>
		</ul>
