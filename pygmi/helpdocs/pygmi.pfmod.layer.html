		<h1>Layer Editor</h1>
		<p>The layer editor allows for the voxel model to be edited from above. Simply select a lithology and draw the model in, as you would in a paint program. Changing the layer allows for the drawing in of lithologies at deeper depths. Please note that on the first few layers there may be sections which are air (due to the DTM), and are thus not editable.</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Model Layer - allows for the display and/or selection of the profile being modelled. The Altitude associated with the layer is also displayed.</li>
			<li>Dataset Drop Box - Allows for a dataset to be faded in and out of the layer with the aid of a slider. This can help when you need to know where the boundaries of geological units are.</li>
			<li>Lithology List - Use this to select which lithology that you are currently drawing. To erase, simply select the Background lithology and draw with that.</li>
			<li>Line Thickness - This allows you to change the pen thickness, which you are drawing with.</li>
			<li>Ranged Copy - The ranged copy function allows for the copying of a lithology on the current layer over a range of layers. You can choose which layers to copy to, and which lithologies can be overwritten.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Tips</h2>
		<p>The ranged copy function can be very useful in getting a starting model going. Draw in your basic lithology boundary and copy it over a range of applicable depths. You can now quickly correct this either in the Layer Editor or the Profile Editor</p>
