		<h1>Normalisation/Scaling</h1>
		<p>Normalisation and scaling are the process of scaling your data to some predetermined range. It is often between 0 and 1, but can be according to a model. Normalisation and scaling are often used when comparing different types of data in routines such as cluster analysis.</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Interval - This simply stretches the data values between 0 and 1.</li>
			<li>Mean - This sets the mean of the dataset to 0, and the standard deviation of the dataset to +/- 1</li>
			<li>Median - This sets the median of the dataset to 0, and the median absolute deviation of the dataset to +/- 1</li>
			<li> 8-bit histogram equalisation - this seeks to distribute the data equally across 255 values.</li>
		</ul>
