		<h1>Quick Start to use PyGMI</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>The new PyGMI interface allows for a flow chart approach to performing various geophysical tasks.</p>
		<h2>Details</h2>
		<p>The menus in PyGMI group tasks into categories:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>By clicking on a menu item, you will see that the item appears as a flow chart element on the main interface.</li>
			<li>By clicking on the <img src="linepointer.png" alt="line connector"> icon on the menubar, it is possible to connect two tasks on the flow chart.</li>
			<li>Double clicking on a task activates the task.</li>
			<li>Right clicking on the task allows for the display of any data and results associated with that task.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Tasks also are colour coded depending on their state:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Blue tasks still need to be activated</li>
			<li>Green tasks have been activated and show a more complete context menu.</li>
			<li>Red tasks are in the process of running.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Dataset Information Pane</h2>
		<p>The dataset information pane shows information about the dataset such as the dataset type (e.g. Raster) and the band names. It displays information when you click on a task which has data connected to it.</p>
		<h2>The Process Log Pane</h2>
		<p>The process log pane shows information about the latest process which you have run. It can be helpful to know how far your processing is, or for debugging purposes.</p>
		<h2>Warnings</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Right clicking on a task is an extremely important part of PyGMI. It is how you display results, get histograms, and export data.</li>
			<li>If you update data in an earlier task, you may need to disconnect and reconnect all later tasks to ensure that the new change is in effect in later tasks.</li>
		</ul>
