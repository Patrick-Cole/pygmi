		<h1>Gradient Calculation</h1>
		<p>The gradient calculation calculates the devrivative of the data in the azimuth specified. It allows for the calcutaion of a conventional horizontal derivative, a derivative ratio (ratio of x and y derivatives), a vertical derivative and a total horizontal derivative.</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Azimuth - Available for both calculations. This is the direction of the derivative, in the plane of the data. It coincides with the direction of the features being highlighted, where 0 degrees is E-W, 45 degrees is NE-SW, -45 degrees is NW-SE and 90 degrees is N-S.</li>
			<li>Strength Factor - This is the strength of the derivative ratio. A value of 1 is recommended as a starting point.</li>
		</ul>
