Overview
========

PyGMI stands for Python Geoscience Modelling and Interpretation. It is a modelling and interpretation suite aimed at magnetic, gravity and other datasets.

PyGMI is developed at the `Council for Geoscience <http://www.geoscience.org.za>`_ (Geological Survey of South Africa).

It includes:

* Magnetic and Gravity 3D forward modelling.
* Cluster Analysis, including use of scikit-learn libraries.
* Routines for cutting, reprojecting and doing simple modifications to data.
* Convenient display of data using pseudo-color, ternary and sunshaded representation.
* MT processing and 1D inversion using MTpy.
* Gravity processing.
* Seismological functions for SEISAN data.
* Remote sensing ratios and improved imports.

It is released under the `Gnu General Public License version 3.0 <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html>`_
