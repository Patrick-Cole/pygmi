Installation
============

PyGMI is a 3D geophysical modelling program designed for the interpretation and modelling of magnetic and gravity data. It uses a voxel based system to achieve this. It currently supports forward-modelling.

Download
--------
PyGMI can be downloaded through `GitHub <https://github.com/Patrick-Cole/pygmi/releases>`_.

Requirements
------------
PyGMI will run on both Windows and Linux. It should be noted that the main development is done in Python 3.5 on Windows.

PyGMI is developed and has been tested with the following libraries in order to function:

* Python 3.5.1
* NumPy 1.10.4
* SciPy 0.17.0
* Matplotlib 1.5.1
* six 1.10.0 (used by Matplotlib, should be installed automatically)
* pytz 2015.7 (used by Matplotlib, should be installed automatically)
* python-dateutil 2.4.2 (used by Matplotlib, should be installed automatically)
* pyparsing 2.0.7 (used by Matplotlib, should be installed automatically)
* cycler 0.9.0 (used by Matplotlib, should be installed automatically)
* PyQt 4.11.4
* GDAL 2.0.2
* numexpr 2.4.6
* numba 0.23.1
* llvmlite 0.8.0 (used by numba, should be installed automatically)
* PyOpenGL 3.1.1b1

It should also still work with the following or newer, if you wish to try installing Python 3.4:

* Python 3.4.3
* NumPy 1.9.2
* SciPy 0.16.0
* Matplotlib 1.4.3
* six 1.9.0 (used by Matplotlib, should be installed automatically)
* pytz 2015.4 (used by Matplotlib, should be installed automatically)
* python-dateutil 2.4.2 (used by Matplotlib, should be installed automatically)
* pyparsing 2.0.3 (used by Matplotlib, should be installed automatically)
* PyQt 4.11.4
* GDAL 1.11.3
* numexpr 2.4.3
* numba 0.20.0
* llvmlite 0.6.0 (used by numba, should be installed automatically)
* PyOpenGL 3.1.0

It is possible that it might work on earlier versions, especially on non-windows operating systems.

Installation
------------

General
^^^^^^^
The easiest way to install pygmi if you are worning in a python environment is to use the pip command as follows:

   pip install pygmi

This will download pygmi from PyPI and install it within your python repository. Alternatively, if you satisfy the requirements, you can download pygmi either from Github or PyPI, extract it and run the following command from within the extracted directory:

   python setup.py install

In either case, running pygmi can be now done at the command prompt as follows:

   pygmi

If you are in python, you can run PyGMI by using the following commands:

   import pygmi
   
   pygmi.main()


Windows
^^^^^^^
I have now made available convenient installers for PyGMI, thanks to `Cyrille Rossant <http://cyrille.rossant.net/create-a-standalone-windows-installer-for-your-python-application/>`_. 

Running the software can be achieved through the shortcut on your desktop.

Linux
^^^^^
Linux normally comes with python installed, but the additional libraries will still need to be installed. One convenient option is to install the above libraries through `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_.

After installation of python, you can follow the instructions under General.

Anaconda
^^^^^^^^
Anaconda does not find pyqt4 on its system even if it is there already. To install pygmi on anaconda, edit the setup.py file, and replace the install_requires switch with the following:

   install_requires=["numpy", "scipy", "matplotlib", "gdal", "numexpr", "numba", "Pillow", "PyOpenGL"],

As you can see, all we have done is removed PyQt4 from the requirements. You will need to make sure it is a part of your conda installation though. From this point the regular command will install pygmi:

   python setup.py install

Alternative execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you prefer not to install pygmi as a library, or if there is a problem with running it in that matter, you can simply execute the following command to run it manually:

   python quickstart.py
