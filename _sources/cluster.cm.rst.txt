Classification: Context Menu
============================
The classification context menus are available for modules which have output clustering data. Output data is only available on green modules. To access the context menu, simply right-click a green module.

Cluster Statistics
------------------
Cluster statistics show the central value of each cluster with respect to each band of data, as well as the associated standard deviation.

Show Class Data
---------------
This provides a quick graphical representation of the output of the cluster analysis

Show Membership Data (Fuzzy Only)
---------------------------------
This relates to fuzzy cluster analysis. It shows in graphical form, the membership of each cluster.

Show OBJ, VRC, NCE, XBI Graphs
------------------------------
This information relates to comparisons between cluster analysis runs over different numbers of classes. If, for example, a crisp cluster run has a minimum of 5 and maximum of 7 classes, then 3 solutions are produced; one with 5, one with 6 and one with 7 classes. This context menu displays information in graphical form which can assist in determining the optimal number of classes present in the data.

The following graphs are produced:

* Objective Function (OBJ) as a 3D graph
* Variance Ratio Criterion (VRC) as a 2D graph
* Normalized Class Entropy (NCE) as a 2D graph
* Xie-Beni Index (XBI) as a 2D graph

Export Data
-----------
This exports the output cluster data in a variety of different formats for use in other software.
