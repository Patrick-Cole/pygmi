Installation
============

PyGMI is a 3D geophysical modelling program designed for the interpretation and modelling of magnetic and gravity data. It uses a voxel based system to achieve this. It currently supports forward-modelling.

Download
--------
PyGMI can be downloaded through `GitHub <https://github.com/Patrick-Cole/pygmi/releases>`_.

Requirements
------------
PyGMI will run on both Windows and Linux. It should be noted that the main development is done in Python 3.7 on Windows.

PyGMI is developed and has been tested with the following libraries in order to function:

* python 3.7.4
* GDAL 3.0.2
* llvmlite 0.29.0
* matplotlib 3.1.1
* numba 0.45.1
* numexpr 2.7.0
* numpy 1.16.5
* pillow 6.2.1
* pandas 0.25.1
* pyopengl 3.1.3b2
* pyqt5 5.13.1
* scipy 1.3.1
* scikit_learn 0.21.3
* scikit_image 0.16.2
* setuptools 41.0.1
* segyio 1.8.8
* geopandas 0.6.1
* pytest 5.1.2
* mtpy 1.1.3

Installation
------------

General (Not Anaconda)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The easiest way to install pygmi if you are worning in a python environment is to use the pip command as follows:

   pip install pygmi

This will download pygmi from PyPI and install it within your python repository. Please note the use of pip when installing PyGMI may cause Anaconda installations to break. Anaconda users should follow the instructions below.

Alternatively, if you satisfy the requirements, you can download pygmi either from Github or PyPI, extract it and run the following command from within the extracted directory:

   python setup.py install

In either case, running pygmi can be now done at the command prompt as follows:

   pygmi

If you are in python, you can run PyGMI by using the following commands:

   import pygmi

   pygmi.main()

If you prefer not to install pygmi as a library, or if there is a problem with running it in that matter, you can simply execute the following command to run it manually:

   python quickstart.py

Windows
^^^^^^^
I have now made available convenient installers for PyGMI, thanks to `Cyrille Rossant <http://cyrille.rossant.net/create-a-standalone-windows-installer-for-your-python-application/>`_.

Running the software can be achieved through the shortcut on your desktop.

You may need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable. It can be obtained from `here <https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#d-visual-c>`_.

Linux
^^^^^
Linux normally comes with python installed, but the additional libraries will still need to be installed. One convenient option is to install the above libraries through `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_.

After installation of python, you can follow the instructions under General.

Anaconda
^^^^^^^^
Anaconda users are advised not to use pip since it can break PyQt5. However, two packages are installed only by pip, so a Conda environment should be created. The process to install is as follows:

   conda create -n pygmi python=3.7
   conda install pyqt
   conda install numpy
   conda install scipy
   conda install numexpr
   conda install gdal
   conda install pillow
   conda install matplotlib
   conda install numba
   conda install pandas
   conda install scikit-learn
   conda install scikit-image
   conda install geopandas
   conda install pyopengl
   conda install pyyaml

   pip install mtpy
   pip install segyio

Once this is done, download pygmi, extract it to a directory, and run it from its root directory with the following command:

   python quickstart.py

Alternatively, if you satisfy the requirements, you can run the following command from within the extracted directory:

   python setup_anaconda.py install

Running pygmi can be now done at the command prompt as follows:

   pygmi
