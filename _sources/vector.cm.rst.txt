Vector Analysis: Context Menu
=============================

The vector context menus are available for modules which have vector output
data. Output data is only available on green modules. To access the context
menu, simply right-click a green module.

Export Line Data
-----------------
This module allows for the export of point or line data.

Show Line Data Profile
----------------------
This module displays line data in profile form. The line and column can be chosen for display

Show Line Data Map
----------------------
This module displays line data in in map form. The line data is displayed in black, superimposed over the x,y location of the data (gray line). The scale parameter changes the anomaly scale.

Show Vector Data
----------------
This is a simple viewer for vector data.

Show Rose Diagrams
------------------
This module calculates and displays rose diagrams. It needs as input shapefile data which has been imported into PyGMI. The user can specify how features are defined, either one angle per feature defined by the start and end point of the feature, or an angle per segment in the feature. The number of angles in the rose diagram can be set as well. A map of the features colour coded is also displayed. Equal area rose diagrams can also be produced.
