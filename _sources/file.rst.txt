File Menu
=========

Introduction
------------
The file menu contains options to open and save projects. A project contains the layout of linked modules, and where possible, it contains all relevant settings.

When loading a project in, note that only import data sections are run automatically. You will either need to run modules manually, or click the play symbol on the toolbar as seen below:

The play option runs the modules in order, with current settings as loaded in the project file. If user input is required, the dialog relating to that module will pop up.
