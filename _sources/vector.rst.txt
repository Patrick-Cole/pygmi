Vector Data Analysis
====================

Introduction
------------
The Vector Menu is a where operations on vector data reside. Here, point data or vector data are imported and displayed. If another menu requires vector data, then it may be imported through this menu.

All vector modules, once activated (module will be green) have a context menu which allows the display of the data. The context menu is accessed by **right clicking** on the module.
