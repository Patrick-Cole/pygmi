Vector Analysis: Description of Modules
=======================================

Import Shapefile Data
---------------------
This module imports ESRI shapefiles. Shapefiles are also referred to as vector data within PyGMI.

Import Point or Line Data
-------------------------
This module imports point data from a text file, for example a csv file. The user must choose the x and y columns.

Options:

* X Channel - This is the column which contains x-coordinates.
* Y Channel - This is the column which contains y-coordinates.
* Null value - This is the null or nodata value in the data.

Cut Points using Polygon
------------------------
This tool provides a quick way to cut out data, using a shape file as the boundary for the cut. You will need to prepare the shape file in another package first.

Reproject Vector Data
---------------------
This is a versatile routine allowing for the reprojecting of a dataset between two projections. All projections are obtained from EPSG codes.

The options are the same for both input and output projections. The choice of projection is obtained through drop boxes.

Dataset Gridding
----------------
The gridding is either nearest neighbour, linear, cubic (all from scipy) or minimum curvature. The input is a point or line or vector dataset, imported from the vector menu. Note that the x and y columns are defined when importing the line or point data.

Options:

* Gridding method - This can be nearest neighbour, linear, cubic or minimum curvature.
* Cell size - This represents the size of a square raster grid cell, in the units of the grid (normally meters).
* Column to grid - This allows you to select the z column to grid.
* Null value - masked data value.
* Blanking distance - This is a distance in cells from data points, beyond which the grid will be masked.
