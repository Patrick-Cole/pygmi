Potential Field Modelling: Context Menu
=======================================
The potential field modelling context menus are available for modules which
have output 3D model data. Output data is only available on green modules. To
access the context menu, simply **right-click** a green module.


3D Model Display
----------------
The 3D model display menu provides a viewer for 3D voxel data. The model can be
rotated using the left and right click buttons on your mouse. The
**mouse wheel** provides zooming of the model.

By default all lithologies are selected. The viewer provides a means to save an image of the model to a .jpg or .png file format.

* Vertical slider - used to adjust the zscale of the model.
* Light Position - this is the position of a light, controlling shadow effects on the model.
* Smooth model - applied smoothing to the model, showing a more aesthetically pleasing version
* Orthographic projection
* Display axis
* Save to image file
* Refresh model - this is used to update the viewer while actively modelling.

Export 3D Model
---------------
This provides a means to export the model in one of 3 formats:

* npz - this is the format adopted for 3D models in PyGMI.
* kmz - this is Google Earth's 3D format.
* xyz - this is an ASCII format, supplied to export the model in a generic
  fashion.
* shapefile - this exports each lithology to a separate shapefile.
